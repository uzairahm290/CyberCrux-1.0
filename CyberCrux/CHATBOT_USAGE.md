    </div>

function ChatModal({ isOpen, onClose }) {
  if (!isOpen) return null;
  
  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 z-50">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üìù FAQ Configuration

The chatbot includes instant FAQ responses for common questions. Edit the `faq` object in `CyberCruxChatbot.jsx` to customize:

```javascript
const faq = {
  "what is cybercrux": "CyberCrux is an AI-powered cybersecurity interview and practice platform to help learners improve their skills.",
  "how to start": "Sign up, choose a cybersecurity topic, and start practicing questions or challenges.",
  "what is sql injection": "SQL injection is a type of attack where an attacker manipulates a database query by injecting malicious SQL code.",
  // Add more FAQ entries here...
};
```

## üé® Customization

### Styling
The components use Tailwind CSS classes. Key styling areas:

- **Message bubbles:** Change colors in the message mapping section
- **Chat header:** Modify the gradient in the header div
- **Input area:** Customize the input and button styles
- **Floating button:** Edit the gradient and animations

### API Integration
The chatbot connects to `/api/chat` endpoint. The backend should accept:

```json
{
  "message": "User's question here"
}
```

And return:
```json
{
  "reply": "AI response here"
}
```
