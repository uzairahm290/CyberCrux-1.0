# AI-Powered Scoring System Setup

## Overview
The practice system now uses Google's Gemini AI to intelligently score scenario, coding, and practical questions, providing much more accurate and meaningful feedback than simple keyword matching.

## Features

### ✅ **Multiple Choice Questions**
- **Database validation**: Uses stored correct answers from database
- **Instant scoring**: Immediate feedback based on exact matches
- **No AI required**: Works offline with existing database

### ✅ **AI-Scored Questions**
- **Scenario Questions**: AI analyzes open-ended responses for understanding
- **Coding Questions**: AI evaluates code quality, security, and correctness
- **Practical Questions**: AI assesses vulnerability identification and analysis

### ✅ **Fallback System**
- **Smart fallback**: When AI is unavailable, uses intelligent content analysis
- **Technical term detection**: Identifies cybersecurity keywords and concepts
- **Content length analysis**: Considers answer depth and completeness

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Google API Key
You need a Google API key with access to Gemini AI:

```bash
# In your .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 2. Get API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key to your environment variables

### 3. Install Dependencies
The required package is already included:
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

## How It Works

### AI Scoring Process
1. **Question Analysis**: AI receives question context, type, and student answer
2. **Intelligent Evaluation**: AI analyzes answer quality, technical accuracy, and completeness
3. **Scoring**: Returns score from 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
4. **Feedback**: Provides explanation and key points for improvement

### Fallback Scoring
When AI is unavailable:
- **Content Analysis**: Evaluates answer length and structure
- **Technical Terms**: Checks for relevant cybersecurity vocabulary
- **Question-Specific**: Uses different criteria for coding vs. scenario questions

## API Endpoint

### POST `/api/ai/score-answer`
**Authentication Required**: Yes (JWT token)

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "prompt": "AI prompt for scoring",
  "questionType": "scenario|coding|practical",
  "questionText": "The actual question text",
  "userAnswer": "Student's answer to evaluate",
  "context": "Additional context or code template",
  "expectedOutput": "Expected output for coding questions",
  "referenceAnswer": "Reference answer if available"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "score": 0.85,
  "explanation": "Good understanding but missing some details",
  "keyPoints": ["Correctly identified main issue", "Missing technical specifics"],
  "rawResponse": "Full AI response text"
}
```

## Question Types & Scoring

### Multiple Choice
- **Scoring**: Database validation (0% or 100%)
- **AI Required**: No
- **Fallback**: Not applicable

### Coding Questions
- **Scoring**: AI analysis of code quality and security
- **AI Required**: Yes (with fallback)
- **Fallback**: Technical term detection + content analysis

### Scenario Questions
- **Scoring**: AI evaluation of understanding and approach
- **AI Required**: Yes (with fallback)
- **Fallback**: Content analysis + security terminology

### Practical Questions
- **Scoring**: AI assessment of vulnerability identification
- **AI Required**: Yes (with fallback)
- **Fallback**: Technical analysis + content depth

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for AI scoring
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Optional: Customize AI model
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash  # Default: gemini-1.5-flash

# Optional: Scoring thresholds
AI_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.7         # Default: 0.7 (70%)
FALLBACK_ENABLED=true          # Default: true
```

### Customization
You can modify the scoring logic in `server.js`:
- **AI prompts**: Customize the scoring instructions
- **Fallback logic**: Adjust content analysis criteria
- **Thresholds**: Change what constitutes a "correct" answer

## Testing

### Test AI Scoring
1. **Start a scenario** with non-multiple-choice questions
2. **Answer questions** with detailed responses
3. **Check results** for AI scores and explanations
4. **Verify fallback** by temporarily disabling AI

### Test Fallback System
1. **Disconnect AI** (remove API key or network issues)
2. **Answer questions** normally
3. **Verify fallback scoring** works correctly
4. **Check scoring information** shows fallback method

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Not Responding
- Check API key validity
- Verify network connectivity
- Check API quota limits
- Review error logs

#### Scoring Inconsistencies
- AI responses may vary slightly
- Fallback scoring provides consistency
- Check question type configuration
- Verify answer format

#### Performance Issues
- AI scoring adds latency
- Consider caching results
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Monitor API usage

### Error Handling
The system gracefully handles:
- **API failures**: Falls back to intelligent scoring
- **Invalid responses**: Uses fallback analysis
- **Network issues**: Continues with offline scoring
- **Authentication errors**: Returns appropriate error messages

## Benefits

### For Students
- **Accurate feedback**: AI understands context and nuance
- **Detailed explanations**: Learn from AI analysis
- **Fair scoring**: Consistent evaluation across all question types
- **Immediate feedback**: Real-time scoring for better learning

### For Educators
- **Quality assessment**: AI evaluates understanding, not just keywords
- **Consistent grading**: Same standards applied to all students
- **Detailed insights**: See where students struggle or excel
- **Scalable evaluation**: Handle large numbers of open-ended responses

### For System
- **Intelligent scoring**: Move beyond simple pattern matching
- **Reliable fallback**: System works even when AI is unavailable
- **Performance optimization**: Only use AI when necessary
- **Future-ready**: Easy to upgrade to newer AI models

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Adaptive scoring**: Adjust difficulty based on student performance
- **Learning analytics**: Track improvement patterns over time
- **Peer comparison**: Compare answers across student groups
- **Custom rubrics**: Educator-defined scoring criteria

### Technical Improvements
